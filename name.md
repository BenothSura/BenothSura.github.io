## What's in a Name?

Why did we choose to name our minyan Benoth Sura?

- Sura was the location of one of the major Babylonian yeshivot. It lasted for over 800 years (3rd-11th c. C.E.) and its scholars were critical to the formation of rabbinic Judaism as we know it.

- From its very inception, the yeshiva of Sura was a hotspot for liturgical innovation. Its founder, [Abba Arikha](http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/127-abba-arika), is said to have written Musaf for Rosh Hashana. Sura was also the home of [Rav Amram Gaon](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/amram-gaon), who wrote the first known siddur (Seder Rav Amram). By referencing his hometown, we assert that we are legitimate inheritors of the ongoing tradition of Jewish prayer.

- According to the gemara, [the Babylonian Talmud](http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1945-ashi) was compiled in Sura. Like the stammaim, we are compilers, and all compilation is editing. Say we were to take one thing that is good, like Iraqi nusah and minhagim, and put it with something that is also good but previously unrelated, like egalitarian prayer space, so that the two would be read together… well, that would be an approach to Jewish tradition with plenty of precedent. Just sayin’. (If you want to know more about the role of editorial work in creating meaning in the Babylonian Talmud, check out the work of [David Weiss Halivni](https://www.magnespress.co.il/Book/%D7%9E%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%AA+%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%AA.aspx?name=%D7%9E%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%AA+%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%AA&code=45-131115&docNo=9&qid=1&cid=234&from=Category/%D7%AA%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%93+%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%94+%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%93%D7%A8%D7%A9.aspx)).

- "Benoth Sura" (בנות סורא) means "daughters of Sura". We chose "benoth" as a deliberate challenge  to the fact that to say "descendants of Sura", you would say "sons of Sura" (בני סורא). Why should men be the default?
